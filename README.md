# Generalized Meta Transaction

Repository containing a gas cost effective standard for meta transaction to be used by any contract to enable native meta transaction feature on any function. 
The approach support signed typed messages so that while signing the data on client side user see a human readable message instead of scary hex string.

You can see the LIVE DEMO <a href="https://metatx.biconomy.io" target="_blank" >Here</a>(works on Ropsten)

The standard is the result of initiative by metamask here https://medium.com/metamask/announcing-a-generalized-metatransaction-contest-abd4f321470b

Biconomy was selected as one of the finalist in the hackathon. Read <a href="https://medium.com/metamask/our-metatransaction-hackathon-winner-a620551ccb9b" target="_blank">here</a>

<h3>How do i use this in my Smart Contracts?</h3>

1. Inherit <a href="https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/master/src/contracts/EIP712MetaTransaction.sol" target="_blank" >EIP712MetaTransaction</a> contract 
2. Use msgSender() method where ever you were using msg.sender
3. (Optional) Use msgRelayer() method to get the relayer address who paid for transaction gas fees
That's it. Pretty simple

<h3>How do i use this in my client code?</h3>
In order to execute meta transactions you just need to call 
executeMetaTransaction(address userAddress, bytes memory functionSignature, bytes32 sigR, bytes32 sigS, uint8 sigV)
inherited from EIP712MetaTransaction.sol
<br/>

userAddress       => externally owned address of the user eg the user address in his metamask wallet<br/>

functionSignature => ABI encoding of function name with its parameter. Use web3 <a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.4/web3-eth-contract.html#methods-mymethod-encodeabi" target="_blank" >encodeABI</a> method here

sigR              => 32 bytes r part of the signature

sigS              => 32 bytes s part of the signature

sigV              => integer v part of the signature


r,s,v can be calculated using web3 <a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0.0-alpha/web3-utils.html#getsignatureparameters" target="_blank" >getSignatureParameters</a> utility method.

Since this standard supports <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712" target="_blank" >EIP-712</a> so signature parameters should be generated using eth_signTypedData_v3 or eth_signTypedData_v4 JSON RPC method.

Check out example front-end code <a href="https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/master/example/react-ui/src/App.js" target="_blank" >here</a> and example solidity code <a href="https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/master/src/contracts/TestContract.sol" target="_blank" >here</a>

This repository is basic implementation of Native Meta Transactions. This reposiory will be updated as per the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1776" target="_blank">EIP-1776</a> to implement native meta transactions with support of batching, transaction expiry etc
